Change the ammount of ingredient for the shared table
Load ingredients on the checklist or dropdown ig? ask teacher what is the best aproach
My aproach would be create another forms and on the other forms I would just choose the ingredient and ammount, and after I add one appears another dropdown to select another ingredient if wanted maybe
